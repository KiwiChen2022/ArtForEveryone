# AI ART NFT

This project has drawn its inspiration from the AI NFT generator found at [dappuniversity](https://github.com/dappuniversity/ai_nft_generator). Starting with the code from this repository as a base, we have expanded upon and improved the original concept extensively. The enhancements are aimed to provide an enriched user experience and unlock a higher level of potential in AI-generated art NFTs. We welcome and appreciate any suggestions for further enhancements and collaborations.
